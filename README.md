Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) for coreset sampling.

This repository contains the source code of the NeurIPS 2024 spotlight paper [*Small Coresets via Negative Dependence: DPPs, Linear Statistics, and Concentration.*](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/poster/93945) 

In short, DPPs can perform training set compression with strong guarantees, better than any i.i.d. sampling.
